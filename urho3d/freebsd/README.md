# FreeBSD dockerized build environment for Urho3D

This branch of the repo contains the information to build and run the FreeBSD DBE
for Urho3D.

Although the main purpose of this docker image is to build Urho3D project, any
Urho3D downstream projects that reuse Urho3D build system may benefit from the
dockerized build environment as well. Thus, you can just simply substitute all the
references to Urho3D project in the README.md with your own project.
